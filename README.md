# Hermes Direct
An Android app that plays the middle man between [Hermes](https://github.com/Alcha/Hermes_Node.js)
(the Discord bot) and a users text messages. When the phone receives a text message, it's forwarded
to Hermes and then sent to the correct user. If the user sends a message to Hermes, it's sent to
this app and then to the correct user.
